## Running the program

See README for commands.

## Signing in

The app shows the sign in view upon starting the program. By entering a valid username into the username field and clicking sign in the program will show the home view. If the user is not already registered, they may do so by clicking the create user button which will open the create user view.

## Creating a user

As stated in the previous section, the user must click the create user button on the login page to move to the create user view. There the user must enter a unique username longer than three characters to move to the home view.

## Writing notes

The user can write notes by clicking on the new note button on the home page. This will open the note view, where the user gives the note a title and writes the content of the note itself. When finished the user must click save to save the note. After clicking the save button the title of the note will show up on the home page and the user may go and edit an already written note.
